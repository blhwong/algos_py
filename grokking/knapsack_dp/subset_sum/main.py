Problem Statement #
Given a set of positive numbers, determine if a subset exists whose sum is equal to a given number ‘S’.

Example 1: #
Input: {1, 2, 3, 7}, S=6
Output: True
The given set has a subset whose sum is '6': {1, 2, 3}
Example 2: #
Input: {1, 2, 7, 1, 5}, S=10
Output: True
The given set has a subset whose sum is '10': {1, 2, 7}
Example 3: #
Input: {1, 3, 4, 8}, S=6
Output: False
The given set does not have any subset whose sum is equal to '6'.
