Problem Statement #
Given an unsorted array of numbers, find the â€˜Kâ€™ largest numbers in it.

Note: For a detailed discussion about different approaches to solve this problem, take a look at Kth Smallest Number.

Example 1:

Input: [3, 1, 5, 12, 2, 11], K = 3
Output: [5, 12, 11]
Example 2:

Input: [5, 12, 11, -1, 12], K = 3
Output: [12, 11, 12]
